Why are there 7 days in a week? By coincidence, this question has come up independently in conversation twice in the last week, and I was curious. Many time conventions make sense due to their ties with astronomy, like there being 24 hours in a day (earth's rotation) and 365ish days in a year (earth's orbit around the sun). Those numbers depend on other numbers, like the fact that there' 24 hours in a day (why?), or the fact that there's 60 minutes in an hour (why??), or that there's 60 seconds in a minute (why???). But, if we accept the idea of an "hour", "minute", and "second" as are primitives, it's easy to see why we'd define one day as 24 hours, since that is how many hours it takes the Earth to spin around itself once. 
However, why would we introduce the idea of a week? It is not tied to any celestial event, and it is not used to compose a greater concept tied to a celestial event (like the hour is used to define a day). It turns out, the reason is simply that 7 was considered a special number by a variety of ancient religions and cultures. They just liked the number 7 a lot 3,500 years ago, and as a result we still, to this day, organize our entire lives around the number, whether it be weekly meetings, weekly meal preps, weekly days off, etc.
