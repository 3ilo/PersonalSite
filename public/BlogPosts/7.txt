Why are there 7 days in a week? Funny enough, this question has come up 
in conversation twice independly in the last week, so I was curious. Many common units of time seem to make sense intrinsically
due to their ties with astronomy and nature. The "day" is based on the time it takes for earth to complete one rotation and 
the "year" is based on the time it takes for the earth to orbit the sun. 
Of course, there are many other units of time which dpo not appear to be based on any particular natural phenomenon. For example, why do we divide a day into specifically 24 intervals, 
or to divide those intervals into 60 smaller intervals?
As an aside, it turns out the ratio 1 day : 24 hours is actually due to observations in nature. It is thought that Ancient Egyptions divided the day into two 12 hour halfs 
because during the night-time half, there were 12 patterns in the stars that could be identified chronologically. 
However, the ratio 1 hour : 60 minutes is likely unrelated to nature and more likely due to the Ancient
Babylonians' tendency to count in base 60.
Regardless of their origins, these units of time are still tightly related to nature because they even divide one day, which is an important property for their definition and utility.
However, the concept of the week does not fit this model. It is neither tied to any celestial event, 
nor used to compose a greater concept that is related to a natural phenomenon. It does not evenly divide one unit of any "natural" measure of time, so where does it come from?
It turns out, it is simply that 7 was considered a special number by a variety of ancient religions and cultures. 
They just liked the number 7 a lot 3,500+ years ago, and as a result we still, to this day, 
organize our entire lives around the number, whether it be weekly meetings, 
weekly meal preps, weekly days off, etc.
