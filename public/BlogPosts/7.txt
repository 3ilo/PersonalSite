Why are there 7 days in a week? Funny enough, this question has come up independently 
in conversation twice in the last week, and I was curious. Many common units of time make sense 
due to their ties with astronomy and nature, like there being 24 hours in a day (earth's rotation) and 
365ish days in a year (earth's orbit around the sun). 
Of course, there does not appear to be a natural reason to divide a day into specifcially 24 intervals, 
or to divide those intervals into 60 smaller intervals, and so on, but those units can still be defined as factors of a day.
Aside: it turns out the ratio 1 day : 24 hours is actually due to observations in nature. It is thought that Ancient Egyptions divided the day into two 12 hour halfs 
because during the night-time half, there were 12 patterns in the stars that could be identified chronologically. 
However, the ratio 1 hours : 60 minutes is likely unrelated to nature and more likely due to the Ancient
Babylonians' tendency to count in base 60.
Regardless of their origins, these types of time units are not too far detached from nature because ultimately they are evenly divisible into one day.
However, the concept of the week does not fit this model. It is not tied to any celestial event, 
and it is not used to compose a greater concept tied to a celestial event. It does not evenly divide into one unit of any "natural" measure of time, so where does it come from?
It turns out, the reason is simply that 7 was considered a special number by a variety of ancient religions and cultures. 
They just liked the number 7 a lot 3,500+ years ago, and as a result we still, to this day, 
organize our entire lives around the number, whether it be weekly meetings, 
weekly meal preps, weekly days off, etc.
